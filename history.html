        Darbhanga was the capital of the Darbhanga Raj, an estate established in the 16th century, and contains the Anandbagh Palace.  Darbhanga is home to the Kameshwara Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University (1961), which is located on the grounds of the palace, and the Lalit Narayan Mithila University (1972).  Grains, oilseeds, tobacco, sugarcane, and mangoes are important crops in the region.  Under the British Raj, Darbhanga was a part of Sarkar Tirhut until 1875, when it was constituted into a separate district. 

 Nonetheless, the region has a linguistic and cultural affinity with Bengal. The area that now comprises the northern part of the Indian state of Bihar was under a state of lawlessness at the end of the empire of the Tughlaq Dynasty.  The Brahmins were dominant in the Mithila region and Mithila had Brahmin kings in the past. Akbar summoned Rajpandit Chandrapati Thakur to Delhi and asked him to name one of his sons who could be made caretaker and tax collector for his lands in Mithila. 

 The first king of this dynasty helped Mughals to uproot Oiniwar dynasty from Mithila.  The Raj Darbhanga also made the Sena chiefs of Makwanpur in Nepal their subordinates with the Sena`s having to pay tribute to the Rajas of Darbhanga. The family and descendants of Mahesh Thakur gradually consolidated their power in social, agrarian, and political matters and came to be regarded as kings of Madhubani.  Darbhanga became the seat of power of the Raj Darbhanga family from 1762. 

 They also had a palace at Rajnagar Bihar situated in Madhubani district.  This litigation decided that the estate was impartible and succession was to be governed by primogeniture.  Zamindari estates in the region, including Darbhanga, actually sought intervention of the Court of Wards from time to time because the stewardship of the British authorities, who invested funds wisely, had a tendency to boost their economic position.  The bureaucratic system introduced by the Court, whose appointed officials had no ties to the area, resolved the issue although, being focussed entirely on what was best for the owners, it did so without considering the consequences for the tenants. 

 Towards the end of the 19th century, 47 percent of the cropped area of the Darbhanga estate was used for the cultivation of rice. Three percent of total cultivation was given over to indigo at that time, making the estate one of the most important centres in the region for this crop prior to the introduction of chemical dyes. After the independence of India from British rule in 1947, the Government of India initiated several land reform actions and the Zamindari system was abolished.  The last ruler of Raj Darbhanga was Maharaja Bahadur Sir Kameshwar Singh. 

 He died in 1962 without naming a successor. The origin of the royal family of Darbhanga is traced to a grant of the Sarkar of Tirhut to Mahesh Thakur by Akbar.  The supporters of the theory that Raj Darbhanga was a kingdom argue that it was held by privy council, that the rulership was a hereditary one with succession governed by primogeniture.  The supporters argue that by the end of the 18th century, the Sarkar of Tirhut was practically an independent kingdom until the conquest of Bengal and Bihar by the British. 

The opponents of the theory argue that Raj Darbhanga was never a kingdom but rather a zamindari with all the trappings of princely state.  The rulers of Raj Darbhanga were the largest landowners in India, and thus were called Raja, and later Maharaja and Maharajadhiraja.  They were given the status of ruling prince. Further, after conquest of Bengal and Bihar, the British Raj initiated the Permanent Settlement, and the Raja of Darbhanga was recognised only as a Zamindar. 

Raj Darbhanga also paid yearly lagan (land tax) to old existing Zamindar of Darbhanga, Kachari at Khan Sahib ki deaorhi. Darbhanga town attained the status of a city (population 1 lakh and above) in 1961.  The old Raj Library has been taken over by the Mithila University.  Mahesh Thakur who founded the Raj was a renowned scholar of Sanskrit.
